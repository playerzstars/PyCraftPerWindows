<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<big>We're just a group of Python developers that love coding. The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused us all to be bored, so why not make a videogame? Thus, PyCraft was born!</big>
<h2>What was our inspiration for this game?</h2>
<big>Judging by the name you may already know that PyCraft is based off the famous game Minecraft.</big>
